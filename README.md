## 🌸 About Me  
Hey there, I’m Yoada 👋 I’ve always had a love for blending **art**, **psychology**, and **tech**. I grew up attending a **tech and arts-focused school**, and that sparked my passion for combining creativity with technology ✨  

I studied **psychology** at **Tennessee State University**, where I focused on **research methodologies**, **stats**, and **user behavior**. After graduation, I started freelancing as a **Web Designer** in **Nashville**, and I've been loving the process of creating designs that are both beautiful and functional ✨

## 💖 Life Outside of Tech  
I come from an Ethiopian family, and that’s where I learned to appreciate the **art of cooking** and the beauty of culture and tradition. 🍲 When I’m not working, you’ll find me spending time in **nature**, spending time with my cat **Nala**, working on **arts and crafts** like **sewing** and **jewelry making**, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen ✨  

I also share my **artwork** which focuses on **dreamy and healing art** on **Pinterest** ([lunarmoonlightchild](https://www.pinterest.com/lunarmoonlightchild/))✨
