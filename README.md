## 🌸 About Me  
Hey there, I’m Yoada! 👋 I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of **art**, **psychology**, and **tech**. Growing up in a **tech and arts-focused school** sparked my passion for blending creativity with technology.  

I studied **psychology** at **Tennessee State University**, where I focused on **research methodologies**, **statistics**, and **user behavior**. After graduating, I started freelancing as a **web designer** in **Nashville**, creating designs that are both beautiful and functional.  

Currently, I’m pursuing a **Master’s in Data Science** at the **Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT)** through **Coursera**. This program is helping me deepen my knowledge in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **AI**, while bridging my passion for psychology and tech. I’m excited to explore how data can drive meaningful insights in fields like **mental health** and **healthcare**.

## 💖 Life Outside of Tech  
I come from an Ethiopian family, and that’s where I learned to appreciate the **art of cooking** and the beauty of culture and tradition. 🍲 When I’m not working, you’ll find me:  
- Spending time in **nature** 🌿  
- Hanging out with my cat, **Nala** 🐱  
- Working on **arts and crafts** like **sewing** and **jewelry making** ✂️  
- Experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen 🍳  

Fun Fact: In 2023, I spent **16,663 minutes** listening to **Mariah Carey** on Spotify, ranking me in the **top 0.005% of listeners** that year! 🎶
