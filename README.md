🌸 About Me
Hey there, I’m Yoada 👋 I’ve always had a love for blending art, psychology, and tech. I grew up attending a tech and arts-focused school, and that sparked my passion for combining creativity with technology ✨

I studied psychology at Tennessee State University, where I focused on research methodologies, stats, and user behavior. After graduation, I started freelancing as a Web Designer in Nashville, and I've been loving the process of creating designs that are both beautiful and functional ✨

Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s in Data Science at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) through Coursera, where I’m deepening my knowledge in data analysis, machine learning, and AI. This program is helping me bridge my passion for psychology and tech, allowing me to explore how data can drive insights in mental health and healthcare.**

💖 Life Outside of Tech
I come from an Ethiopian family, and that’s where I learned to appreciate the art of cooking and the beauty of culture and tradition. 🍲 When I’m not working, you’ll find me spending time in nature, spending time with my cat Nala, working on arts and crafts like sewing and jewelry making, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen ✨

Fun Fact: In 2023, I spent a whopping 16,663 minutes listening to Mariah Carey on Spotify, ranking in the top 0.005% of listeners that year ✨
