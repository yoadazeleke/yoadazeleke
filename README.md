## 🌸 A Little About Me  
Hi there! I’m Yoada, and my journey into tech started long before college—it was practically part of my DNA growing up. I attended a **predominantly arts and technology-focused school from kindergarten through 12th grade**, where I got to explore everything from coding basics to creative design. Those years really shaped my love for blending **art** and **tech** in meaningful ways.  

I went on to study **psychology** at **Tennessee State University**, where I graduated **summa cum laude**. My favorite part? Diving deep into **research methodologies**, **statistics** (both descriptive and inferential), and **user research**, which helped me understand how people think and interact with the world. During college, I even tutored other students in statistics, which solidified my love for making complex concepts approachable.  

After college, I decided to combine my passions for **psychology**, **design**, and **technology**. I’ve been freelancing as a **Web Designer** in **Nashville**, focusing on creating intuitive user experiences. Platforms like **Behance** and **Dribbble** have been my creative playgrounds, where I share designs and connect with like-minded creators.

## 💖 What I Love Outside of Work  
When I’m not designing or deep-diving into tech, I’m all about **music**—especially listening to my queen, **Mariah Carey**. Her voice is pure magic and has been a constant source of inspiration for me.  

I also love spending time in **nature**, whether it’s hiking, going for walks, or just taking a moment to breathe outside. When I’m feeling creative, I enjoy **arts and crafts** like **sewing**, **jewelry making**, and experimenting with new DIY projects.  

Cooking and **reading** are my go-to activities for relaxation, and when I’m feeling artsy, you’ll find me on **Pinterest** sharing my dreamy, abstract, healing digital art ([lunarmoonlightchild](https://www.pinterest.com/lunarmoonlightchild/)).

I’m passionate about creating tech solutions that make people’s lives better—whether it’s through intuitive design, data-driven insights, or exploring new technologies. My background has taught me that **understanding people** and **building meaningful tools** go hand in hand, and I can’t wait to see where this path takes me next.
